<h1>Game of Life</h1>
<p>
  This is just some fun with a classic cellurar automaton. The rules are described in detail on
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Wikipedia</a> with all relevant information. The rules are copied from Wikipedia with some additional cralrification.
</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The game is played on infinite plane. In practice this would mean that objects are moving from one end of plane to other</li>
  <li>Each cell has 8 neighbours and can be in 2 states. Live or dead.</li>
  <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</li>
  <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
  <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
  <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I will use D3 to animate the changes over SVG component. The game itself is a simple class which allows to iterate and view
  the evolution of life based on the rules above.
